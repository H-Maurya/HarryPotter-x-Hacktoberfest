          <p class="desc">
            Lord Voldemort, born Tom Riddle, is the primary antagonist in the
            Harry Potter series. He's a dark wizard who seeks power and believes
            in pure-blood wizard supremacy. His creation of Horcruxes makes him
            nearly immortal. Voldemort's nemesis is Harry Potter, and he
            instigates two wizarding wars. With a snake-like appearance and
            mastery of dark magic, he symbolizes evil in the series but also
            represents themes of fear and the corrupting influence of power.

            Potter but also as a symbol of wisdom, integrity, and moral
